* **Literature:** [Virginia Woolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf), [Irvin Yalom](https://www.yalom.com/books), [Tiesheng Shi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Tiesheng)

# Charity

My primary charitable commitment is supporting the education of students in need through long-term, focused aid.

### 📚 **Supporting Rural Middle School Education**

I have been a dedicated supporter of the **Fangcao Young Volunteer Association (芳草青年志愿者协会)** at USTC since **2019**.

* **Focus:** Providing financial assistance to **two middle school girls** from underserved areas in rural China.
* **Commitment:** Donations are made **each semester** to ensure sustained support throughout their education. The funds are strictly earmarked to cover **study-related necessities** (such as books, stationery, etc), ensuring direct impact on their academic success.
* **Personal Involvement:** Beyond financial support, I write regular letters to them. This correspondence allows for a personal connection, offering encouragement and guidance throughout their academic journeys.

I believe sustained educational support, combined with personal encouragement, is one of the most effective ways to foster long-term positive change.
